        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the sauce even if you only have time for a quick 20 minute simmer. Though if you can slow cook for a couple of hours, it really
        takes it to another level.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>2 tsp white sugar, if needed</li>
            <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>400g / 13 oz spaghetti, dried</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol> <!-- An ordered list relaying the steps required to take to reproduce the product in the image supplied. -->
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.)</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 
                20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 
                2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta 
                per steps below.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute</li>
            <li>Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes, 
                or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</li>
