This will be my second attempt at working through the odin project projects. Self teaching my way through web
development and eventually on to further software related projects.


Learning to commit, add and push on github with

git add filename.exe
git commit -m "name"



git status == Allows checking of current files ready for commit.
git log == Gives you a log of all changes that you have made to your repository.

git push origin main == Pushed your commits to their origin location on github.
